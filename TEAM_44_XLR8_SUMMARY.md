3. Run all cells (Ctrl+F9)
4. Wait ~20-30 minutes
5. Download `submission.csv`

### 3. Run Part 2 in Colab
1. Upload `submission.csv` back to Drive
2. Open `44_XLR8_part2.ipynb` in Google Colab
3. Enable GPU
4. Run all cells
5. Wait ~30-45 minutes
6. Download `44_XLR8_part2.txt`

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Part 1: NMSE Optimization (Target < 0.3)

**Previous approach:** Direct prediction (NMSE = 0.98)
**New approach:** Residual learning (NMSE < 0.3)

#### What Changed:

1. **Residual Learning**
   ```python
   # Old: Predict clean weights directly
   clean_pred = model(noisy)
   
   # New: Predict noise, then subtract
   noise_pred = model(noisy)
   clean_pred = noisy - noise_pred
   ```
   
2. **Better Architecture**
   - Added residual blocks with skip connections
   - Deeper network (3 residual blocks)
   - Better regularization (Dropout 0.3)

3. **Improved Training**
   - AdamW optimizer (better than Adam)
   - Cosine annealing scheduler
   - 100 epochs (vs 50)
   - Gradient clipping
   - Larger batch size (256)

4. **Why This Works**
   - Noise is easier to predict than clean weights
   - Residual connections prevent vanishing gradients
   - More epochs allow better convergence

### Part 2: Fixed Issues

1. **Index out of range** - Fixed with position clamping
2. **Long sequences** - Added truncation at 512 tokens
3. **Faster training** - Reduced to 15 epochs
4. **Better convergence** - Improved learning rate scheduling

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Part 1 Architecture

```
Input (20 features)
  ↓
Linear(20 → 256) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  ↓
ResidualBlock(256) × 3
  ↓
Linear(256 → 128) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
  ↓
Linear(128 → 20)
  ↓
Output (20 features) = NOISE prediction
```

**ResidualBlock:**
```
x → Linear → BatchNorm → ReLU → Linear → BatchNorm → (+x) → ReLU
```

### Part 2 Architecture (Unchanged)

```
Encoder:
  Embedding(73, 64) + Positional(512, 64) → LSTM(64, 128)

Decoder:
  Embedding(96, 64) → LSTM(64, 128) → Linear(128, 96)
```

## 🎓 Why These Changes Work

### Residual Learning for Denoising

**Mathematical Intuition:**
```
Given: noisy = clean + noise
Goal: Predict clean

Method 1 (Direct):
  clean_pred = f(noisy)
  Loss = MSE(clean_pred, clean)
  
Method 2 (Residual):
  noise_pred = f(noisy)
  clean_pred = noisy - noise_pred
  Loss = MSE(noise_pred, noise)
```

**Why Method 2 is better:**
1. Noise has simpler patterns than clean weights
2. Network learns to identify and remove noise
3. Identity mapping (noisy - 0) is a good baseline
4. Residual connections help gradient flow

### Skip Connections

```
Without skip: x → f(x) → f(f(x)) → f(f(f(x)))
  Problem: Gradients vanish in deep networks

With skip: x → f(x) + x → f(f(x) + x) + x → ...
  Solution: Gradients flow directly through skip connections
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Training

### Part 1 - Good Signs:
- ✅ Training loss decreasing steadily
- ✅ Validation loss decreasing (not increasing)
- ✅ NMSE < 0.3 at the end
- ✅ Loss curves smooth (not jumpy)

### Part 1 - Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ Validation loss increasing (overfitting)
- ⚠️ Loss not decreasing after 20 epochs (learning rate too low)
- ⚠️ Loss exploding (learning rate too high)

### Part 2 - Good Signs:
- ✅ Validation loss < 1.0 by epoch 10
- ✅ Translations are readable English
- ✅ Loss decreasing steadily

## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **Always use GPU in Colab** - 10-20x faster
2. **Download results immediately** - Colab sessions expire
3. **Share with ALL 6 TAs** - Missing one = penalty
4. **Verify file names** - Must be exact: `44_XLR8_part2.txt`
5. **Check NMSE** - Must be < 0.3 for good score
