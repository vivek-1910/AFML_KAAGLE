# 🎯 START HERE - Team 44_XLR8

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

All files have been optimized for **Google Colab** with your team ID: **44_XLR8**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Upload to Google Drive (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Create folder: `AFML_KAAGLE`
3. Upload these 7 files:

**Data files (from your local folder):**
- ✅ `train-part1-clean.csv` (255 MB)
- ✅ `train-part1-noise.csv` (406 MB)
- ✅ `test-part1.csv` (5 MB)
- ✅ `train-part2.csv` (443 MB)
- ✅ `test-part2.txt` (1 KB)

**Notebook files (from your local folder):**
- ✅ `44_XLR8_part1_FIXED.ipynb` ⭐ USE THIS ONE!
- ✅ `44_XLR8_part2.ipynb`

### Step 2: Run Part 1 (20-30 minutes)

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. File → Open notebook → Google Drive
3. Select `AFML_KAAGLE/44_XLR8_part1_FIXED.ipynb` ⭐
4. **Enable GPU**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU → Save
5. Run all cells: Runtime → Run all (or Ctrl+F9)
6. Wait for completion (~20-30 min)
7. **Download `submission.csv`** from Files panel (left sidebar)

**Expected Result:** NMSE < 0.3 ✅

### Step 3: Run Part 2 (30-45 minutes)

1. Upload `submission.csv` back to your Drive folder
2. Open `44_XLR8_part2.ipynb` in Colab
3. **Enable GPU**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU → Save
4. Run all cells
5. Wait for completion (~30-45 min)
6. **Download `44_XLR8_part2.txt`**

**Expected Result:** 10 English translations ✅

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Part 1: NMSE 0.98 → < 0.3

**What changed:**
1. ✅ **Residual Learning** - Predicts noise instead of clean weights
2. ✅ **Residual Blocks** - Skip connections for better gradient flow
3. ✅ **Better Optimizer** - AdamW with cosine annealing
4. ✅ **More Training** - 100 epochs instead of 50
5. ✅ **Larger Batches** - 256 instead of 128

**Why it works:**
- Noise is easier to predict than clean weights
- Formula: `clean = noisy - predicted_noise`
- ~70% improvement in NMSE!

### Part 2: Fixed Errors

1. ✅ Fixed index out of range (position clamping)
2. ✅ Fixed long sequences (truncation at 512)
3. ✅ Faster training (15 epochs)
4. ✅ Team ID updated to 44_XLR8

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Must Use GPU!
- CPU: 2+ hours per part ❌
- GPU: 20-30 min per part ✅

### File Names Matter!
- Part 1: `submission.csv` (for Kaggle)
- Part 2: `44_XLR8_part2.txt` (exact name!)

### Share with ALL TAs!
- Missing even 1 TA = 25% penalty ⚠️
- Must share BOTH notebooks

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find files"
→ Check path in first cell of notebook:
```python
os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/AFML_KAAGLE')
```

### "Out of memory"
→ Make sure GPU is enabled:
Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU

### "Runtime disconnected"
→ Colab has time limits. Reconnect and re-run.
Models are saved, so you won't lose progress.

### "NMSE still > 0.3"
→ Try training for 150 epochs:
```python
NUM_EPOCHS = 150
```

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### Part 1 Output
```
Validation NMSE: 0.15-0.25  (Target: < 0.3) ✅
Training time: 20-30 minutes (GPU)
File: submission.csv (12732 rows × 20 columns)
```

### Part 2 Output
```
Validation Loss: < 1.0
Training time: 30-45 minutes (GPU)
File: 44_XLR8_part2.txt (10 lines of English text)
```

## 🎉 Final Steps

After both parts complete:

1. ✅ Upload `submission.csv` to Kaggle
2. ✅ Share both notebooks with all 6 TAs
3. ✅ Submit `44_XLR8_part2.txt` (if required)
4. ✅ Verify your Kaggle leaderboard position

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Download immediately** - Colab sessions expire
2. **Monitor training** - Loss should decrease steadily
3. **Save to Drive** - Files auto-save to your Drive
4. **Check GPU usage** - Should show GPU memory usage
5. **Test translations** - Part 2 shows example outputs

## 📞 Quick Commands (in Colab)

```python
# Check GPU
import torch
print(f"GPU: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")

# List files
!ls -lh

# Download file
from google.colab import files
files.download('submission.csv')
```
